================================React Js =====================================
React.js is indeed a JavaScript library developed by Facebook (now Meta) for building user interfaces, 
particularly for single-page applications (SPAs). It allows developers to create reusable components and
efficiently manage the rendering and updating of the UI in response to changes in data, making 
it very efficient for building dynamic and interactive web applications.


USE EFFECT
useEffect in React is a hook that allows you to perform side effects (like data fetching, subscriptions, 
or manual DOM manipulations) in function components. It runs after the component renders and can be 
triggered on specific state or prop changes.
